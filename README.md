## Purpose
The main goal of this challenge was to use the Data from the Citi Bike Programme in New York City to build a business proposal that shows the use of shareable bikes in New York and if this same idea could be also used in Des Moine. In order to build the business proposal, we needed to clean the Data with python tools and then create a visualization project to suport our study.
