# Bikesharing
## Purpose
The main goal of this challenge was to use the Data from the Citi Bike Programme in New York City to build a business proposal that shows the use of shareable bikes in New York and if this same idea could be also used in Des Moine. In order to build the business proposal, we needed to clean the Data with python tools and then create a visualization project to suport our study.

It can be concluded that the service is used mostly between 7-9 AM and 4-7 PM, which can lead to the conclusion that the services is not used recreationally but to commute to work.
### Trips By Weekday Per Day

This view gives an idea of the times when the service is used the most, it shows that Monday to Friday it is used to commute and the Saturday and Sunday for Recreational purposes.
## Summary
I believe that the results show the purpose of the Citi Bike service, it is used during the week to commute to work and then in the weekends is used for recreational purposes. two additional visualizations for future Analysis would be to find the specific gender use during the weekend and also during 7-9 am and 4-7 pm.
